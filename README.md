## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Recommendation Model**: Machine Learning model to match donations to suitable NGOs.
- **Other Tools**: GitHub, Postman

## 🤖 AI Model
An AI model predicts and recommends the most efficient NGO for a pickup by considering:
- Distance to the pickup location
- Availability status

This ensures faster pickups, less food spoilage, and optimized distribution.

## 🎯 Use Cases
